                   <p>A broken Record
<p>By: Terez L. Johnson
<p> A time I felt shocked was when I was nine years old. It was when my parents woke me up out my sleep which was about talking dogs that taught humans how to make a hovercraft.
 That’s when my parents told me to go in their room to talk about something very important. They made me feel like I was about to be punished probably for not  cleaning my room or something that happened at school but they just didn't say anything. So suddenly my stepdad said “Terez go watch some cartoons.” So I went to the living room and sat on the floor cause I felt like it, and turned the TV on and begin to JJ the jet plane about a talking jet plane named Jj, with friend named Trixie the helicopter. I begin just hearing their faint voices over the TV's volume, so I turned the volume down some till the point I could hear their voices slightly clear to hear them conversing something about me. That's when out nowhere I started to gain a temptation to go their door, which seemed like a juvenile detention camp and listen with my big ears as if I had super hearing. I just couldn't because I was being held back somehow. So I just sat there and could only wonder into a place where could talk to myself and receive a answer it was conscience, that's when my step dad called me “Terez come here” I replied “yes sir” that's when I started heading to their room with fear growing like a six ,four giant bully. That's when I came upon the door and I begin to turn the knob ever so slightly that you could hear an  search up the way that they say ant walking on carpet just then the door opened and I walked in. “Come sit on the bed”,my mom said nervously so I did struggling to climb the tall bed which made me  feel like I was climbing Mt. Everest that's when I notice some photos in her hands of a man a bald black short man. Out of nowhere she said that's your real father a begin how he broke into someone's house and made the house owner pea in bottles while being tied up so I looked at her confused. I just got up and grabbed the pictures from her and took them with me to my room. I didn't know what to think so plumped down onto the floor. Then I started to wonder why my step dad wasn't my real dad. “It's a lie it a lie” I kept saying because my step dad was my ideal image. I look at him no other way but as my dad and not as a step dad because I respect him. No one could come tell me that wasn't my real dad because he and my mom raised me right. I love my father but the bond I have with my step father even when there's times that I am mad at him because of something I did. That's a time I felt shocked.
